Project Visualization Examples
==============================

This module provides utility functions for creating visualizations to analyze and understand the features of the project. These visualizations use various plotting libraries, such as Plotly and Matplotlib, and typically require a data object and optional parameters.

.. note::
    Some functions in this module may use interactive plotting libraries like Plotly. If you're using `JupyterLab`_,
    additional setup might be required to render these visualizations. Please follow the `installation guide`_ for enabling support in JupyterLab.

.. note::
    Specific visualizations may require additional Python packages to be installed, such as `scikit-learn <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn>`__. Ensure you have all necessary dependencies for the visualizations you wish to generate.
