Paper 1:
Title: Is your code generated by chatgpt really correct? rigorous evaluation of large language models for code generation
Abstract:

Program synthesis has been long studied with recent approaches focused on
directly using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code.
Programming benchmarks, with curated synthesis problems and test-cases, are
used to measure the performance of various LLMs on code synthesis. However,
these test-cases can be limited in both quantity and quality for fully
assessing the functional correctness of the generated code. Such limitation in
the existing benchmarks begs the following question: In the era of LLMs, is the
code generated really correct? To answer this, we propose EvalPlus -- a code
synthesis evaluation framework to rigorously benchmark the functional
correctness of LLM-synthesized code. EvalPlus augments a given evaluation
dataset with large amounts of test-cases newly produced by an automatic test
input generator, powered by both LLM- and mutation-based strategies. While
EvalPlus is general, we extend the test-cases of the popular HumanEval
benchmark by 80x to build HumanEval+. Our extensive evaluation across 26
popular LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 and ChatGPT) demonstrates that HumanEval+ is able to
catch significant amounts of previously undetected wrong code synthesized by
LLMs, reducing the pass@k by up-to 19.3-28.9%. We also surprisingly found that
test insufficiency can lead to mis-ranking. For example, both
WizardCoder-CodeLlama and Phind-CodeLlama now outperform ChatGPT on HumanEval+,
while none of them could on HumanEval. Our work not only indicates that prior
popular code synthesis evaluation results do not accurately reflect the true
performance of LLMs for code synthesis, but also opens up a new direction to
improve such programming benchmarks through automated testing. We have
open-sourced our tools, enhanced datasets as well as all LLM-generated code at
https://github.com/evalplus/evalplus to facilitate and accelerate future
LLM-for-code research.

Paper 2:
Title: Self-planning code generation with large language models
Abstract:

Large language models have demonstrated the ability to generate both natural
language and programming language text. Such models open up the possibility of
multi-language code generation: could code generation models generalize
knowledge from one language to another? Although contemporary code generation
models can generate semantically correct Python code, little is known about
their abilities with other languages. We propose MultiPL-E, a system for
translating unit test-driven code generation benchmarks to new languages. We
create the first massively multilingual code generation benchmark by using
MultiPL-E to translate two popular Python code generation benchmarks to 18
additional programming languages.
  We use MultiPL-E to extend the HumanEval benchmark and MBPP benchmark to 18
languages that encompass a range of programming paradigms and popularity. Using
these new parallel benchmarks, we evaluate the multi-language performance of
three state-of-the-art code generation models: Codex, CodeGen, and InCoder. We
find that Codex matches or even exceeds its performance on Python for several
other languages. The range of programming languages represented in MultiPL-E
allow us to explore the impact of language frequency and language features on
model performance. Finally, the MultiPL-E approach of compiling code generation
benchmarks to new programming languages is both scalable and extensible, making
it straightforward to evaluate new models, benchmarks, and languages.

Paper 3:
Title: Planning with large language models for code generation
Abstract:

Developing domain models is one of the few remaining places that require
manual human labor in AI planning. Thus, in order to make planning more
accessible, it is desirable to automate the process of domain model generation.
To this end, we investigate if large language models (LLMs) can be used to
generate planning domain models from simple textual descriptions. Specifically,
we introduce a framework for automated evaluation of LLM-generated domains by
comparing the sets of plans for domain instances. Finally, we perform an
empirical analysis of 7 large language models, including coding and chat models
across 9 different planning domains, and under three classes of natural
language domain descriptions. Our results indicate that LLMs, particularly
those with high parameter counts, exhibit a moderate level of proficiency in
generating correct planning domains from natural language descriptions. Our
code is available at https://github.com/IBM/NL2PDDL.

Title: A survey on evaluating large language models in code generation tasks
Abstract:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current methods and metrics
used to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code
generation tasks. With the rapid growth in demand for automated software
development, LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in the field of code
generation. The paper begins by reviewing the historical development of LLMs
and their applications in code generation. Next, it details various methods and
metrics for assessing the code generation capabilities of LLMs, including code
correctness, efficiency, readability, and evaluation methods based on expert
review and user experience. The paper also evaluates the widely used benchmark
datasets, identifying their limitations and proposing directions for future
improvements. Specifically, the paper analyzes the performance of code
generation models across different tasks by combining multiple evaluation
metrics, such as code compilation/interpretation success rates, unit test pass
rates, and performance and efficiency metrics, to comprehensively assess the
practical application of LLMs in code generation. Finally, the paper discusses
the challenges faced in evaluating LLMs in code generation, particularly how to
ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of evaluation methods and how to
adapt to the evolving practices of software development. These analyses and
discussions provide valuable insights for further optimizing and improving the
application of LLMs in code generation tasks.

Paper 2:
Title: A systematic evaluation of large language models of code
Abstract:

Language models (LMs) have exhibited impressive abilities in generating codes
from natural language requirements. In this work, we highlight the diversity of
code generated by LMs as a critical criterion for evaluating their code
generation capabilities, in addition to functional correctness. Despite its
practical implications, there is a lack of studies focused on assessing the
diversity of generated code, which overlooks its importance in the development
of code LMs. We propose a systematic approach to evaluate the diversity of
generated code, utilizing various metrics for inter-code similarity as well as
functional correctness. Specifically, we introduce a pairwise code similarity
measure that leverages large LMs&#39; capabilities in code understanding and
reasoning, demonstrating the highest correlation with human judgment. We
extensively investigate the impact of various factors on the quality of
generated code, including model sizes, temperatures, training approaches,
prompting strategies, and the difficulty of input problems. Our consistent
observation of a positive correlation between the test pass score and the
inter-code similarity score indicates that current LMs tend to produce
functionally correct code with limited diversity.

Paper 3:
Title: Program synthesis with large language models
Abstract:

GitHub Copilot, an extension for the Visual Studio Code development
environment powered by the large-scale language model Codex, makes automatic
program synthesis available for software developers. This model has been
extensively studied in the field of deep learning, however, a comparison to
genetic programming, which is also known for its performance in automatic
program synthesis, has not yet been carried out. In this paper, we evaluate
GitHub Copilot on standard program synthesis benchmark problems and compare the
achieved results with those from the genetic programming literature. In
addition, we discuss the performance of both approaches. We find that the
performance of the two approaches on the benchmark problems is quite similar,
however, in comparison to GitHub Copilot, the program synthesis approaches
based on genetic programming are not yet mature enough to support programmers
in practical software development. Genetic programming usually needs a huge
amount of expensive hand-labeled training cases and takes too much time to
generate solutions. Furthermore, source code generated by genetic programming
approaches is often bloated and difficult to understand. For future work on
program synthesis with genetic programming, we suggest researchers to focus on
improving the execution time, readability, and usability.

Paper 4:
Title: Jigsaw: Large language models meet program synthesis
Abstract:

Large pre-trained language models such as GPT-3, Codex, and Google&#39;s language
model are now capable of generating code from natural language specifications
of programmer intent. We view these developments with a mixture of optimism and
caution. On the optimistic side, such large language models have the potential
to improve productivity by providing an automated AI pair programmer for every
programmer in the world. On the cautionary side, since these large language
models do not understand program semantics, they offer no guarantees about
quality of the suggested code. In this paper, we present an approach to augment
these large language models with post-processing steps based on program
analysis and synthesis techniques, that understand the syntax and semantics of
programs. Further, we show that such techniques can make use of user feedback
and improve with usage. We present our experiences from building and evaluating
such a tool jigsaw, targeted at synthesizing code for using Python Pandas API
using multi-modal inputs. Our experience suggests that as these large language
models evolve for synthesizing code from intent, jigsaw has an important role
to play in improving the accuracy of the systems.

Paper 5:
Title: A hazard analysis framework for code synthesis large language models
Abstract:

Codex, a large language model (LLM) trained on a variety of codebases,
exceeds the previous state of the art in its capacity to synthesize and
generate code. Although Codex provides a plethora of benefits, models that may
generate code on such scale have significant limitations, alignment problems,
the potential to be misused, and the possibility to increase the rate of
progress in technical fields that may themselves have destabilizing impacts or
have misuse potential. Yet such safety impacts are not yet known or remain to
be explored. In this paper, we outline a hazard analysis framework constructed
at OpenAI to uncover hazards or safety risks that the deployment of models like
Codex may impose technically, socially, politically, and economically. The
analysis is informed by a novel evaluation framework that determines the
capacity of advanced code generation techniques against the complexity and
expressivity of specification prompts, and their capability to understand and
execute them relative to human ability.

The summary is:

1. The main topic: This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models in synthesizing Python programs from natural language descriptions, focusing on their performance in generating outputs for general-purpose programming tasks.

2. Existing problems: Previous studies and datasets in program synthesis predominantly targeted domain-specific languages or utilized coding competition problems, which often obfuscate algorithms, leading to poor model performance. There has been a lack of focused benchmarking for general-purpose programming languages like Python that can assess model capabilities effectively.

3. The main contributions: The paper introduces two novel datasets, the Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP) and MathQA-Python, which contain structured and clearer programming tasks to facilitate better model evaluation. It finds that model performance improves significantly when fine-tuned on coding tasks and demonstrates the potential of integrating human feedback to enhance the generation of code.

4. Experimental results: The evaluation encompassed multiple models with sizes ranging from 244M to 137B parameters on the MBPP and MathQA-Python datasets. Models achieved a synthesis rate of 59.6% on MBPP through few-shot learning and improved by about 10 percentage points with fine-tuning; the best model on MathQA-Python reached 83.8% accuracy. Compared to past benchmarks, these results indicate substantial progress in leveraging general language models for code synthesis.

5. Conclusions: The findings indicate that large language models can successfully synthesize code from natural language descriptions, with performance scaling log-linearly with model size. The incorporation of human feedback significantly cuts error rates, suggesting a promising avenue for improving code generation tasks. Future research should focus on enhancing these models&#39; capabilities to predict program outputs and further refining their performance across diverse programming challenges.
