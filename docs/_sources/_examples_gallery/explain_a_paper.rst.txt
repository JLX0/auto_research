Explain a Paper with LLMs
=====================================

This script demonstrates the usage of `AutoSurvey` in the :mod:`auto_research.survey.core` module to:

- Select a PDF file from a specified folder.

- Retrieve an API key for the LLM (Large Language Model).

- Run an automated survey analysis using the selected PDF and the LLM.

To get started with the package, you need to set up API keys. For detailed instructions, see :ref:`setting_up_api_keys`.

This script assumes that

- At least one valid PDF file of the article is available. (located at "sample_articles/")

- A valid key.json file is available (located at the current working directory (""))

The process involves user interaction, including selecting a PDF file and asking questions about its content.
