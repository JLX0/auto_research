Summarize All Papers in a Folder
=====================================

This script demonstrates the usage of `AutoSurvey` from :mod:`auto_research.survey.core` module to:

- Iterate through all PDF files in a specified folder.
- Retrieve an API key for the LLM (Large Language Model).
- Run an automated survey analysis on each PDF file using the LLM.
- Accumulate and display the total cost of running the analysis.
- Print summaries for all processed PDF files.

To get started with the package, you need to set up API keys. For detailed instructions, see :ref:`setting_up_api_keys`.

This script assumes that:

- At least one valid PDF file of the article is available. (located at "sample_articles/")
- A valid `key.json` file is available (located at the current working directory (""))

    The summary is:

    1. The main topic: The paper introduces a new hyperparameter optimization (HPO) method called BOHB, which combines Bayesian optimization and bandit-based methods to enhance the performance and efficiency of HPO in machine learning.

    2. Existing problems: Previous HPO methods, including vanilla Bayesian optimization and Hyperband, face limitations such as slow convergence to optimal configurations, ineffectiveness in parallel resource utilization, and inability to handle diverse hyperparameter types and high-dimensional spaces efficiently.

    3. The main contributions: BOHB is proposed as a robust, flexible, and scalable HPO method that achieves strong anytime and final performance while effectively utilizing resources. The paper provides an extensive empirical evaluation showing BOHB's superiority over various existing state-of-the-art approaches.

    4. Experimental results: The authors evaluate BOHB on various benchmarks, including high-dimensional toy functions, support vector machines, neural networks, and deep reinforcement learning. The results demonstrate that BOHB converges significantly faster to optimal configurations compared to both Bayesian optimization and Hyperband.

    5. Conclusions: The findings highlight that BOHB provides a practical solution for HPO that balances efficiency and performance across a range of tasks. The authors plan to enhance BOHB further by optimizing budget allocation to improve user experience and adaptability, indicating a commitment to advancing the HPO field.
